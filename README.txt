Hello! My name is Benjamin Heath McCarley, but I go by Heath

Topics I find interesting
1. Automation and having things run independently when needed
2. Artificial intelligence
3. Game making
4. Streamlining processes
5. The art of creation. I was originally an art major who was interested in computers, but I realized I was more fascinated with the creation of something rather than the art itself.

Topics that are troublesome
1. red squiggles for no reason
2. setting up compilers (my pc hates them due to my C: and D: drives being wonky (set them up badly))
3. using the %. What does this do. Does anyone know? Maybe not.
4. Defining things. I still don't quite understand the concept
5. Typing. I feel I am limited by this mortal shell and cannot wait to project my thoughts directly into the computer.
